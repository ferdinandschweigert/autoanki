# Adalbert - Anki MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enriches Anki exam decks with AI-generated German explanations using configurable LLM providers (Gemini, TogetherAI, OpenAI-compatible).

🌐 **Live Website**: [https://adalbertanki.vercel.app](https://adalbertanki.vercel.app)

> **Note**: "Adalbert" is used as a personal project name. This is an open-source educational tool with no commercial affiliation or copyright claims to the name.

## How It Works

**MCP is NOT a CLI** - it's a background server that runs in Cursor. When you talk to me (Adalbert), I can call these tools to:

- Read your exam .apkg files
- Enrich cards with German explanations via an LLM provider
- Sync enriched cards directly to Anki Desktop (no import/export!)

## Quick Start

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed installation instructions.

## Prerequisites

1. **Anki Desktop** with **AnkiConnect add-on** installed

   - Install AnkiConnect: Code `2055492159` in Anki
   - Make sure Anki Desktop is running
2. **LLM API Key** (Gemini/TogetherAI/OpenAI-compatible)

   - Gemini: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - TogetherAI: https://api.together.xyz
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com

### Optional LLM Configuration

- `LLM_PROVIDER`: `gemini` (default), `together`, `openai`, `openai-compatible`
- `LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDERS`: e.g. `together,openai`
- `LLM_MODEL` or provider-specific `GEMINI_MODEL`, `TOGETHER_MODEL`, `OPENAI_MODEL`
- `LLM_BASE_URL` for `openai-compatible`

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
jnpm run build
```

3. Configure Cursor MCP (see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for details)
4. Restart Cursor

Usage

Once configured, just ask me (Adalbert):

- "List my Anki decks"
- "Get cards from my 'Orthopädie' deck"
- "Enrich these cards with German explanations"
- "Sync the enriched cards to my 'Prüfungsvorbereitung' deck"

### Direct Anki Integration

The server can read cards directly from your Anki Desktop decks (no export needed!):

- Reads all fields including question, options (Q_1 to Q_5), and answer codes
- Preserves original answers in a separate field
- Adds enriched explanations without losing existing data

## Card Enrichment

Each card gets enriched with:

- **✅ LÖSUNG** - The correct answer(s) clearly stated at the top
- **📚 ERKLÄRUNG** - Detailed German explanation:
  - General introduction to the concept
  - Why the correct options are correct
  - Why the incorrect options are wrong
- **💡 ESELSBRÜCKE** - Memory aids (mnemonics) when applicable
- **📖 REFERENZ** - References to textbooks/guidelines (e.g., "Duale Reihe Orthopädie")

### Supported Question Types

- **KPRIM** (Multiple correct answers) - e.g., "1 1 0 1"
- **MC** (Multiple Choice) - Single correct answer
- **SC** (Single Choice) - One correct answer

The system automatically reads options from Anki cards and generates explanations for each option.

## How It Connects

The MCP server runs as a background process that Cursor communicates with. You never need to run commands manually - just talk to me and I'll handle everything!
